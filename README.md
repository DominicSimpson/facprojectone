# facprojectone: Tribute page to Buckminster Fuller

###### For my tribute page, part of a series of projects required as part of my application to Founders & Coders, I thought an interesting tribute would be to the American visionary and architect Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller.

###### I first discovered who Fuller was when I visited the Montreal Biosphere around ten years ago, pictured both in the photo above and in the one below (the latter taken by myself) - an environmental music inside Fuller's trademark geodesic dome. It was built to house the American pavillion at the 1967 World Fair in Canada.

###### To create a professional effect, I used Google Fonts; after experimenting with different typefaces, I utilised Oswald sans-serif for the heading with Fuller's name, and then 'Uchen' serif for the h2 sub-heading (also utilised at the foot of the page). Meanwhile, for the section headings, I used Archivo Black, a font that I particularly like, and one that I think fitted Fuller's retro-futurist aesthetic.

###### Also of a retro-futurist bent was the background color I used for the body of the document - Antique White. Over this, I added the main section container, which featured the text and images. I decided to make the background straight white for this because a number of the images were on a white background, and so blended well. This includes the Dymaxion car.

###### Initially, I featured the time and date at the top of the document, but it didn't blend in well with the heading, so I relocated it at the footer, together with my name. The document looks less cluttered as a result.
