# facprojectone: Tribute page to Buckminster Fuller

###### For my tribute page, part of a series of projects required as part of my application to Founders & Coders, I thought an interesting tribute would be to the American visionary and architect Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller.

###### I first discovered who Fuller was when I visited the Montreal Biosphere around ten years ago - an environmental music inside Fuller's trademark geodesic dome.
