# facprojectone: Tribute page to Buckminster Fuller

###### For my tribute page, part of a series of projects required as part of my application to Founders & Coders, I thought an interesting tribute would be to the American visionary and architect Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller.

###### I first discovered who Fuller was when I visited the Montreal Biosphere around ten years ago - an environmental music inside Fuller's trademark geodesic dome.

###### To create a professional effect, I used Google Fonts; after experimenting with different typefaces, I utilised Oswald sans-serif for the heading with Fuller's name, and then 'Uchen' serif for the h2 sub-heading (also utilised at the foot of the page). Meanwhile, for the section headings, I used Archivo Black, a font that I particularly like, and one that I think fitted Fuller's retro-futurist aesthetic.
